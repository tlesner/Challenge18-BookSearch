## Description
This is a MERN stack application built with MongoDB database, Express.js, React, and Node.js that serves as a functioning Google Books API search engine. The API was refactored to be a GraphQL API build with Apollo Server. Users are able to create accounts on the application, search for books, save books to their personal account, view all saved books, and remove any saved books.

## Tests
The application is working correctly if, when the application first loads, users are directed to the Book Search page, where they can search for any book using the Google Books API. Users can signup or login without errors. When logged in, users can save books to their account, then navigate to the 'See Your Books' tab, where users can view all books they have previously saved, as well as remove any books from that list.
